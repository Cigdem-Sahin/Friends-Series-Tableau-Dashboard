## **Analytical Uses:**

This dashboard utilizes a word cloud for directors, a horizontal bar chart for total episodes by season, a vertical bar chart for total votes by season and episode, and a box plot for total stars by season and episode. In addition, the dashboard allows you to filter the episode and show season, episode, year, duration in units, total stars, and total votes information for the filtered episode.

This dashboard can be used for various analytical purposes such as understanding the influence of directors on the series, measuring audience preferences between seasons and series episodes, analyzing the total votes given for each season and episode, and accessing all detailed information about each selected episode of Friends series.
